        <img src="images/chaco.jpg" alt="province-picture">
        <p>Argentina is a beautiful country. It is full of culture and variety. My province, Chaco, is located in northern Argentina and is a place with high temperatures. In summer we can reach temperatures of around 122Â° F. In this province we have 2 stakes but no temple yet, that is why at every general conference we are always excited about the temple announcements. We are still praying for the one in this region to be announced.</p>
